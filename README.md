No worries is a sound equipment hire business specialing in live amplification with recording facilities. Our initial range is Bristol and Bath though we might go further. Our prices can be i) the basic P.A., ii) small bands or Karaoke or iii) full live recording facilities using 16 track desk. (Full live recording will be good quality, but not so good you could release it).

Our name No Worries comes from the business concept that we we will turn up with everything we need, so that all you need do is plug in and enjoy!
